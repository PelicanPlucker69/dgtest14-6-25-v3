        <p>At Dental Garden, we are committed to providing exceptional dental care. However, it is essential to 
           understand the following:
           <br>
           <br>
                1. Individual Results May Vary: Dental treatments can yield different outcomes for each patient.
                Factors such as oral health, genetics, and lifestyle play a role in treatment effectiveness.
           <br>
           <br>
                2. Consultation Required: Before undergoing any dental procedure, we recommend scheduling a
                consultation with our experienced clinicians. They will assess your unique needs and recommend
                personalised treatment options.
           <br>
           <br>
                3. Informed Consent: Prior to any treatment, we ensure that patients receive comprehensive information
                about the procedure, potential risks, benefits, and alternatives. Informed consent is crucial for your 
                peace of mind.
           <br>
           <br>
                4. No Guarantees: While we strive for optimal results, we cannot guarantee specific outcomes. Dental
                treatments are influenced by various factors, and individual responses vary.
           <br>
           <br>
                5. Continual Care: Dental health requires ongoing maintenance. Regular check-ups, hygiene practices,
                and adherence to post-treatment instructions contribute to long-lasting results.
           <br>
           <br>
                Remember that our team is here to guide you through your dental journey. If you have any questions or
                concerns, feel free to reach out to us.
